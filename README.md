# First taste of using Go

This is my first practical experience getting to grips with the basics of Go with Jake Clarkson alongside the School of Code cohort 4 (thanks Jake!).

### Files:

- helloWorld: basic variables and functions
- mypkg: first package created
- usingPackages: using mypkg
- structs: learning about structs and how to construct/work with them
